# Clean 

The data collected for the VisuWay project is far from clean. There are many bad images of blurry cows, cows jammed together, or occluded.
The worst data is the good images that are incorrectly labeled. Cleaning for this project was critical as it is for many if not most machine learning projects. 
I will describe here how the cleaning process was implemented.
